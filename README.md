Decision tree

In the third lab assignment we will implement the decision tree algorithm and analyse the problems and extensions of this machine learning algorithm.

Despite the fact that we are using a single example throughout the instructions, your implementation must work for all files attached with this assignment in reasonable time period (max. 2 minutes). Together with the attached files, your implementation will also be tested with an autograder using examples which are not published, so make sure that you cover all the edge cases that might introduce issues to your implementation. Together with the lab assignment, you will get access to a sample of test examples, so you can try running them locally.

Deadline for solution submission on Moodle does not include the last minute in the day, so make sure that you upload the archive with your solution before 23:59. Submissions uploaded exactly at 23:59 or after will be considered as late submissions.

Please read, in detail, the instructions for input and output formatting in the Sec- tion ‚ÄúAutograder instructions‚Äù as well as the sample outputs in chapter ‚ÄúOutput exam- ples‚Äù. In case your submitted lab assignment cannot be compiled or executed with the autograder it will be graded with 0 points without exception. Your code may not use any external libraries. If you are not sure whether you are allowed to use some library, check whether it is part of the standard library package for that language. To compute the logarithm in base 2 when computing entropy you can use the built-in library math in python, java.lang.Math for Java and &lt;math.h&gt; for c++.

1. Data loading

In order to apply our decision tree algorithm to various tasks, we will first define a stan- dardised input format for the dataset file. A classic dataset format used throughout machine learning is csv (comma separated values). Files in csv format contain values separated with commas. Each line of the file contains the same number of values. In our case, the values represent features used in our machine learning algorithm. The first line of the file will always be the header, which contains the names of the features found in each column. Even though in practice this might be different, for the purpose of this lab assignment the comma symbol will not be found in the feature values.

An example of the first two lines for the dataset file for the example from the lectures (the first line is the header):

<pre>weather,temperature,humidity,wind,play
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì Programming assignment 3

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<pre>sunny,hot,high,weak,no
</pre>
A convention in machine learning is to use the last column for the class label. All other columns will contain features. In the scope of this lab assignment we will always have a single label, which can have an arbitrary number of values.

2. ID3 decision tree (12 points)

In this part of the lab assignment we will implement the ID3 algorithm for learning a decision tree. We recommend that when writing your code, you adhere to the machine learning algorithm design principles similar to the scikit-learn machine learning library:

Each machine learning agorithm should be implemented as a separate class, with the following functionalities:

1. A constructor which accepts and stores the algorithm hyperparameters

2. The fit method, which obtains a dataset as an argument and performs model

learning

3. The predict method, which obtains a dataset as an argument and performs pre-

diction of the class label based on a trained model

For the case of our basic version of the ID3 decision tree, our algorithm will not use any hyperparameters, but this will change in subsequent tasks. An important distinction between the functionalities of the methods our machine learning algorithm should imple- ment is that the model is trained only in the fit method, while the predict method only serves to produce the predictions based on an already trained model (the model is not trained on the test data!).

For implementing the ID3 algorithm you can use the pseudocode of ID3 algorithm from the slides in the presentation ‚Äú10. Machine learning‚Äù. Note: Pseudocode from the slides is different from that in Croatian version of the video presentation for the lecture ‚Äú10. Machine learning‚Äù, so make sure that you follow the code from the slides and implement the algorithm according to that.

When predicting (the predict method), if the trained model is faced with a yet unseen feature value, it should return the most frequent observed value of the class label in the subset of training dataset for that node. In case there are multiple values of the class label with the same highest frequency, choose the first one according to alphabetical order (if the choice is between A, B and C, we will choose A).

The pseudocode of our ID3 algorithm usage could look as follows:

<pre>model = ID3() # construct model instance
model.fit(train_dataset) # learn the model
predictions = model.predict(test_dataset) # generate predictions on unseen data
</pre>
An example of the control output for the ID3 decision tree construction for the volleyball.csv dataset:

<pre>IG(weather)=0.2467 IG(humidity)=0.1518 IG(wind)=0.0481 IG(temperature)=0.0292
IG(wind)=0.9710 IG(temperature)=0.0200 IG(humidity)=0.0200
IG(humidity)=0.9710 IG(temperature)=0.5710 IG(wind)=0.0200
</pre>
Your algorithm does not have to produce this output, we are adding it purely for debug- ging and validity checking purposes. The control output is sorted according to information

gain. A line in control output corresponds to information gain calculation for a single node, starting from the root down to the leaves.

As a result of learning the decision tree, your algorithm must print (1) all the branches in the decision tree that lead to each node. Each branch must be printed in a separate line. Output for each branch should contain the name of feature used for splitting the dataset in each node in the branch and the feature value for which the classification continues on the current branch. Finally, at the end of each branch you should output the value of the class label for that branch (leaf value). Before printing all the branches, it is necessary to print the keyword ‚Äú[BRANCHES]:‚Äù in a separate line, after which all the branches should be printed.

Output values for each branch should be formatted according to the following rules:

<ul>
<li>outputforeachnodeinthebranchshouldbeintheformatlevel:feature_name=feature_value, where level represents the depth of the node, feature_name the name of the fe-

ature used for splitting in that node, and feature_value the value of the feature

for which classification continues in the current branch,</li>
<li>nodes should be ordered by depth, from the smallest to the largest, and separated by a single whitespace,</li>
<li>output for the leaf node should contain only the value of the class label in that leaf. An example of such output for the training set from volleyball.csv:
<pre>[BRANCHES]:
1:weather=cloudy yes
1:weather=rainy 2:wind=strong no
1:weather=rainy 2:wind=weak yes
1:weather=sunny 2:humidity=high no
1:weather=sunny 2:humidity=normal yes
</pre>
This output will be evaluated with the autograder. The order of the branches does not have to be the same as in the provided examples, but it is necessary to output all the branches.

After printing all the branches in the tree, your algorithm must output (2) predictions for all the examples in the test set. The order of predictions for the examples in the test set must be the same as their order in the input file. Before the predictions, you should output the keyword ‚Äú[PREDICTIONS]:‚Äù, and after it (in the same line) predictions separated by a single whitespace. An example of such output for the test set from volleyball_test.csv:

<pre>[PREDICTIONS]: yes yes yes yes no yes yes yes no yes yes no yes no no yes yes
    yes yes
</pre>
3. Evaluating model performance (4 points)

Once we have learned our model, we would like to summarize its performance on data. To do this, we will implement the calculation of accuracy score and confusion matrix. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly classified examples over the total number of examples:

accuracy ‚Äú correct (1) total
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì Programming assignment 3

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Together with the previously mentioned information about the branches in the tree and predictions, your algorithm must also output (3) accuracy on the test set. This line must be formatted as follows (an example for the test set from volleyball_test.csv):

<pre>[ACCURACY]: 0.57895
</pre>
Numerical value of the accuracy must be rounded to five digits.

Accuracy is a measure which summarizes the algorithm performance with a single

number ‚Äì but, it is possible that our model performs better for one label value than for the others. To find out the performance of our model for each distinct class label, we will also implement the calculation of confusion matrix. A detailed description of the confusion matrix can be found online, but a brief explanation is as follows:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
A

B

C

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Predicted class ABC

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Pred=A True=A

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Pred=B True=A

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
In our example A, B and C are the values of the class label. In the confusion matrix we make a distinction between errors based on the true and predicted value of the class label. The shape of the confusion matrix is Y ÀÜ Y , where Y is the number of distinct values of our class label. Each cell of the confusion matrix contains the number of instances for which we have obtained the mentioned combination of predicted and actual value.

After accuracy, your algorithm must output (4) the confusion matrix for the test set. Before printing the matrix, it is necessary to print the keyword ‚Äú[CONFUSION_MATRIX]:‚Äù in a separate line. In the output of the confusion matrix you should output only the values from each cell of the matrix (not the values of the class label), with columns separated by a single whitespace. An example of such output for test set from volleyball_test.csv:

[CONFUSION_MATRIX]: 47

17

When printing the confusion matrix, rows and columns representing class label values must be sorted alphabetically (as in the previous example).

Set of class label values displayed in the confusion matrix should contain only (1) true labels of examples from the test set and (2) predicted values for the test set. Class label values that appeared in the training set, but not in the true or predicted values of the test set, must not be included in the confusion matrix. For example, if the train set

contained class label values A, B and C, but the test set contains only true labels A and B, and prediction on the test also returned only values A and B, row and column for class value C must not be printed in the confusion matrix.

In case your output does not contain some of the four elements required in the output ((1) branches, (2) predictions, (3) accuracy, and (4) confusion matrix), it will be considered that you have not implemented that part of the lab assignment.

4. Limiting the tree depth (8 points)

The ID3 algorithm often runs into problems with overfitting due to the tree depth growing until all the examples are correctly classified or all the features are exhausted. Along with pruning, another method of regularizing our decision tree model is to limit its maximum depth. In this task, we will extend our implementation of the ID3 algorithm to include the maximum depth hyperparameter. This hyperparameter will be passed as the third argument in the command line when running your code. If the argument is not passed, the depth of the tree is considered to be unlimited.

A consequence of limiting the depth of our decision tree is that we will not always converge to a single class label in every leaf node (the subset of data which is incorrectly classified in that node may contain multiple possible values of the class label). To solve this, we will implement a democratic solution. In the nodes in which we don‚Äôt have a single class label, our algorithm should return the most frequent observed value of the class label for that node. In case there are multiple values of the class label with the same highest frequency, choose the first one according to alphabetical order (if the choice is between A, B and C, we will choose A).

The output of the ID3 decision tree with limited depth should be formatted the same as the output for the ID3 tree with unlimited depth. In case when maximum depth of the tree is set to 0, the root node of the tree is considered as leaf node, and the output in the field ‚ÄúBRANCHES‚Äù should contain only the output for the leaf node (i.e., the value of the class label obtained using the described democratic solution). An example of output for such case can be found in the chapter ‚ÄúOutput examples‚Äù.

An example of the full test output for a decision tree with its depth limited to 1 for training set volleyball.csv and test set volleyball_test.csv:

<pre>[BRANCHES]:
1:weather=cloudy yes
1:weather=rainy yes
1:weather=sunny no
